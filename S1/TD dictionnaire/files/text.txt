  This is the official 'Unoffical' Monty Python And The Holy Grail screenplay.
This file contains the script as it was on March 20 1974, before filming took
place.  There are many minor differences from what appears here and what
ended up on the screen.  <I.E. A paraphrased word or two or another
character used a line... But generally in minor lines like 'LOOK!'>
This file also contains cut scenes and lines from the film.
